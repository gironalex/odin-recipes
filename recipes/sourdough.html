  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Baking sourdough is an art that requires patience. 
    The <strong>San Francisco Sourdough Bread</strong> came from a place 
    where nourishment was scarce, during the California Gold Rush.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 3/4 cups bread flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>

    <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons margarine, softened</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups sourdough starter</li>
    <li>1 extra large egg</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>

      Allow to rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in 
      volume.
